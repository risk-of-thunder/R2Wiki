## Contributing

Anyone can edit this wiki, as long as you have a GitHub account.

### Creating a new page
Please head to this [link](https://github.com/risk-of-thunder/R2Wiki/wiki/_new) and format the title of your page as follow:

`Required-Category_Optional-Sub-Category_Page-Name`

You should **always** put a category for your page!

Here is how the page named `FirstFolder_This-is-folder2_This-is-the-file-name` looks in the sidebar once it gets added to the generated github pages website.

Note: The [GitHub Pages Website](https://risk-of-thunder.github.io/R2Wiki) only gets updated every 24 hours! If you think your awesome contribution really needs to be available asap on the website, please ask the maintainers in the [modding discord](https://discord.gg/5MbXZvd).

### Editing an existing page

Head to the page you want to edit, and click the top right button which looks like a pen.

The button should redirect you to the correct edit page, it it doesn't:
- Make sure you are logged into your account
- If it still leads you to an empty creation page, please report the faulty page in a [new issue in the repository](https://github.com/risk-of-thunder/R2Wiki/issues).
