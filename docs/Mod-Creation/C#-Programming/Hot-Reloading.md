This stuff is coitus in a can if you can get it working. Takes some setup so it's only worth it for certain cases but in those cases it'll probably save you hours and hours.

## What is
This allows you hot reload code while the game is running. You're not reloading your entire mod as it might sound, but you can reload one class, which can be pretty powerful.  
As the example in that repo shows, this can be used to essentially write hooks at runtime, so a very powerful way to use this is to hook your own code and change it as you please, again, while the game is still running. No need for recompiling or building.
