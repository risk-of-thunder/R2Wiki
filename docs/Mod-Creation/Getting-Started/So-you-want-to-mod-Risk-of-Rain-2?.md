# So you want to mod Risk of Rain 2?

Modding Risk of Rain 2 can be really demanding. A solo developer would need to know the entire game development stack (coding, modeling, sound design, etc). Oftentimes people work as teams or commission others for skill sets, they're missing, but it is possible to do everything solo. 

This page is meant to be a learning reference for any skills you might feel weak in or want to learn so you can mod the game effectively. You don't need to do it all to make good mods!
