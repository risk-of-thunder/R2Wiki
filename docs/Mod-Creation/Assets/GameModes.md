# Creating a Game Mode

Using R2API's ContentAddition, ensure your prefab has the following:

* Add an "x" to the beginning of your prefab name. e.g. "xJudgementRun"
* Add the `GameModeInfo` component to your prefab, and fill the `buttonHoverDescription` attribute with the text/token to be shown when hovering over the Game Mode's button.
